# testing-reusable-repos

This is an example of how to use the Dynamic README reusable workflow from https://github.com/thoughtbot/templates

The README will then be updated to use the markdown content from this file: https://github.com/thoughtbot/templates/blob/main/templates/footer.md

<!-- START /templates/footer.md -->
<!-- END /templates/footer.md -->
